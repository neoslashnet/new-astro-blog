# Welcome to My Tech Blog! 

## About Me 👨‍💻

I am an IT Consultant turned Cybersecurity Architect with a passion for DevOps, Cybersecurity, and Cloud technologies. Committed to lifelong learning, I enjoy sharing my industry adventures through blogging.

## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I believe writing and sharing is the best way to learn! I created this blog, where I keep things that I've learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

More than just technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a IT professional.
