# A blog theme for Astro
This is a simple blog theme for **Astro** that uses `md` and `mdx` files to store your content.

## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I believe writing and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I've learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

More than just technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a IT professional.
