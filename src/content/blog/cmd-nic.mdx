Often I work with network devices locally that require a static IP address. Once I am done I usually need to set my network adapter back to DHCP. I recently created a batch file to save me the hassle of going back to "Control Panel", etc.

**netsh interface ip set address "Local Area Connection" dhcp  
netsh interface ip set dns "Local Area Connection" dhcp**

You can also use netsh to set a static IP address if you'd like.

```powershell
netsh interface ip set address "connection name" static 
192.168.0.101 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1  
netsh interface ip add dns "connection name" 8.8.8.8
```
