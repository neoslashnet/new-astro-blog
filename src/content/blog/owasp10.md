# Introduction

As I was studying for the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) certification, I studied various aspects of cybersecurity and the methodologies to protect web applications. One of the resources I came across was the OWASP Top 10, which highlights the most common and impactful security risks facing web applications today. Given its relevance, I decided to cover this topic in a blog post to share some thoughts and help others understand these security risks.

The OWASP Top 10 is a widely recognized standard for web application security. This list identifies the most critical security risks to web applications and provides guidance on how to mitigate them. Understanding and addressing these risks is essential for anyone involved in developing, maintaining, or securing web applications.

Alright, let's explore each of the top ten security risks identified by OWASP, discuss the potential impacts of these vulnerabilities, and offer practical mitigation techniques to help safeguard your web applications.

#### 1. Broken Access Control

Broken access control can result in unauthorized access to both systems and data, leading to information being disclosed, modified, or destroyed without permission. Common access control failures include:

- Ignoring the principles of least privilege and deny by default, resulting in users having access to resources they do not need.
- Insecure direct object references, which allow users to view or edit another person’s account by providing the identifier.
- Lack of access controls for POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, which can allow unauthorized API access.

**Mitigation techniques:**

- Follow the principle of least privilege and deny by default.
- Log failed sign-in attempts and send alerts after a suspicious number of failures.
- Apply rate limiting to controller and API access to hinder automated exploitation tools.

#### 2. Cryptographic Failures

If cryptographic protections fail, they can impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation of data. Improper cryptography can result in data breaches and regulatory violations.

**Best practices:**

- Use secure protocols like HTTPS.
- Employ up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and ensure correct implementation.
- Use strong keys and manage them securely.

#### 3. Injection

Injections occur when user inputs aren’t sanitized or validated, allowing attackers to send malicious inputs. SQL injection is a common type, but other forms exist.

**Mitigation techniques:**

- Review source code and use automated testing on inputs.
- Ensure proper sanitization and validation of user inputs.

#### 4. Insecure Design

Insecure design occurs when a web application is designed without appropriate security considerations, leading to exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation techniques:**

- Follow a secure design methodology throughout all stages of software development.
- Conduct thorough risk assessments to identify and implement necessary security controls.

#### 5. Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfigurations can involve unnecessary accounts, privileges, services, pages, ports, and other features. Each unnecessary feature increases the attack surface area.

**Mitigation techniques:**

- Harden configurations and implement strong security baselines.
- Keep software up-to-date and use strong, unique passwords.

#### 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Common problems include using unsupported, outdated, or vulnerable software, and not being aware of the latest security issues.

**Mitigation techniques:**

- Subscribe to security bulletins for your components and scan for vulnerabilities.
- Apply patches in a timely and risk-based fashion.

#### 7. Identification and Authentication Failures

Appropriate mechanisms must be in place to authenticate user identity and manage sessions securely. Common issues include weak passwords and lack of multi-factor authentication.

**Mitigation techniques:**

- Use strong, hashed passwords and store them securely.
- Implement multi-factor authentication.
- Limit login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

#### 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures

To ensure software security, verify its integrity. Using modules, libraries, or plugins from untrusted sources can lead to unauthorized access and system compromise.

**Mitigation techniques:**

- Use and verify digital signatures for software legitimacy.
- Consider using software supply chain security tools.

#### 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Monitoring and logging are crucial for detecting and responding to security incidents. Poorly tuned monitoring tools and lack of logging can lead to missed attacks.

**Mitigation techniques:**

- Log failed login attempts and send alerts for suspicious activity.
- Regularly back up logs.
- Tune monitoring tools to balance sensitivity and false positives.

#### 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

SSRF involves an attacker crafting a request to an unexpected destination, bypassing protections. This occurs when user-supplied URLs aren’t sanitized and validated.

**Mitigation techniques:**

- Follow deny-by-default firewall policies.
- Disable HTTP redirections.

Understanding and mitigating these risks is crucial for maintaining the security of web applications. Implementing best practices and staying updated on the latest security threats helps organizations protect their systems and data from potential attacks.
