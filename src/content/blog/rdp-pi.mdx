I've started using Raspberry Pi as a small management box at branch offices where there is little to no infrastructure. This is useful in scenarios where I have VPN access but doesn't always want to send traffic across. Maybe it's just me but sometimes I like to be on the local network.

Initially I didn't know you could enable RDP on Raspbian. Turns out it is quite simple.

Run the following commands

```bash
sudo apt install update

sudo apt install upgrade

sudo apt install xrdp
```

After this is installed you can confirm the IP address on the Raspberry Pi by running ***ifconfig.***

Once you get the IP address you can RDP into the Raspberry Pi via Windows or macOS.
